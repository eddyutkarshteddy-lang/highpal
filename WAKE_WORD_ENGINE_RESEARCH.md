   - No wake word needed - users can interrupt naturally
   - Matches Sesame.com's professional feel
   - Better for educational conversations (no memorization required)

2. **Cost Effective** üí∞
   - Silero VAD: FREE (open source)
   - Azure Streaming: $83.33/month (100 users)
   - Total: $88.33/month vs $91.65 with Porcupine
   - 4% cost savings

3. **Faster Implementation** ‚ö°
   - 1-2 days vs 2-3 days for Porcupine
   - No new API keys needed (use existing Azure)
   - Leverage existing Azure infrastructure

4. **Better Performance** üöÄ
   - 2x faster interrupt latency (180-360ms vs 450-650ms)
   - Real-time streaming transcripts (see partial results)
   - Smoother conversation flow

5. **Future-Proof** üîÆ
   - Easy migration to Deepgram later (for 74% cost savings)
   - Modern continuous listening architecture
   - Scalable for advanced features

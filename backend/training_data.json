The other two numbers can\nthen be arranged in 2 ways in the remaining blanks. So, if 1 is in the \u0000rst place and 5 is in the 5th place, the\nother numbers can be arranged in 2*2 = 4 ways. Similar for 1 and 3; 5 and 1; 3 and 1; 5 and 3; 3 and 5. So, 5\noccurs 8 times, 1 8 times and 3 8 times. Similar is the case when odd numbers are placed in 3rd and 5th\nplaces.\nOn the whole, 4 occurs 12 times, 2 occurs 12 times, 5, 3 and 1 each occur 16 times.

Odd numbers can occupy\nplaces 1 and 3 in 3C2*2! = 6 ways. When 2 is at the 5th place, the other odd number and 4 can be arranged in\nthe remaining places in 2 ways. So, 2 occurs at the end 6*2 = 12 times. Similarly, 4 occurs 12 times.\nIf odd numbers occupy places 1 and 5, then 2 or 4 should come in the 3rd place. The other two numbers can\nthen be arranged in 2 ways in the remaining blanks. So, if 1 is in the \u0000rst place and 5 is in the 5th place, the\nother numbers can be arranged in 2*2 = 4 ways. Similar for 1 and 3; 5 and 1; 3 and 1; 5 and 3; 3 and 5. So, 5\noccurs 8 times, 1 8 times and 3 8 times. Similar is the case when odd numbers are placed in 3rd and 5th\nplaces.\nOn the whole, 4 occurs 12 times, 2 occurs 12 times, 5, 3 and 1 each occur 16 times.

The other two numbers can\nthen be arranged in 2 ways in the remaining blanks. So, if 1 is in the \u0000rst place and 5 is in the 5th place, the\nother numbers can be arranged in 2*2 = 4 ways.

So, 2 occurs at the end 6*2 = 12 times. Similarly, 4 occurs 12 times.\nIf odd numbers occupy places 1 and 5, then 2 or 4 should come in the 3rd place. The other two numbers can\nthen be arranged in 2 ways in the remaining blanks. So, if 1 is in the \u0000rst place and 5 is in the 5th place, the\nother numbers can be arranged in 2*2 = 4 ways.

The other two numbers can\nthen be arranged in 2 ways in the remaining blanks. So, if 1 is in the \u0000rst place and 5 is in the 5th place, the\nother numbers can be arranged in 2*2 = 4 ways.

Odd numbers can occupy\nplaces 1 and 3 in 3C2*2! = 6 ways. When 2 is at the 5th place, the other odd number and 4 can be arranged in\nthe remaining places in 2 ways. So, 2 occurs at the end 6*2 = 12 times. Similarly, 4 occurs 12 times.\nIf odd numbers occupy places 1 and 5, then 2 or 4 should come in the 3rd place. The other two numbers can\nthen be arranged in 2 ways in the remaining blanks. So, if 1 is in the \u0000rst place and 5 is in the 5th place, the\nother numbers can be arranged in 2*2 = 4 ways. Similar for 1 and 3; 5 and 1; 3 and 1; 5 and 3; 3 and 5. So, 5\noccurs 8 times, 1 8 times and 3 8 times. Similar is the case when odd numbers are placed in 3rd and 5th\nplaces.\nOn the whole, 4 occurs 12 times, 2 occurs 12 times, 5, 3 and 1 each occur 16 times.

The other two numbers can\nthen be arranged in 2 ways in the remaining blanks. So, if 1 is in the \u0000rst place and 5 is in the 5th place, the\nother numbers can be arranged in 2*2 = 4 ways.

So, 2 occurs at the end 6*2 = 12 times. Similarly, 4 occurs 12 times.\nIf odd numbers occupy places 1 and 5, then 2 or 4 should come in the 3rd place. The other two numbers can\nthen be arranged in 2 ways in the remaining blanks. So, if 1 is in the \u0000rst place and 5 is in the 5th place, the\nother numbers can be arranged in 2*2 = 4 ways.

The other two numbers can\nthen be arranged in 2 ways in the remaining blanks. So, if 1 is in the \u0000rst place and 5 is in the 5th place, the\nother numbers can be arranged in 2*2 = 4 ways.

Odd numbers can occupy\nplaces 1 and 3 in 3C2*2! = 6 ways. When 2 is at the 5th place, the other odd number and 4 can be arranged in\nthe remaining places in 2 ways. So, 2 occurs at the end 6*2 = 12 times. Similarly, 4 occurs 12 times.\nIf odd numbers occupy places 1 and 5, then 2 or 4 should come in the 3rd place. The other two numbers can\nthen be arranged in 2 ways in the remaining blanks. So, if 1 is in the \u0000rst place and 5 is in the 5th place, the\nother numbers can be arranged in 2*2 = 4 ways. Similar for 1 and 3; 5 and 1; 3 and 1; 5 and 3; 3 and 5. So, 5\noccurs 8 times, 1 8 times and 3 8 times. Similar is the case when odd numbers are placed in 3rd and 5th\nplaces.\nOn the whole, 4 occurs 12 times, 2 occurs 12 times, 5, 3 and 1 each occur 16 times.

The other two numbers can\nthen be arranged in 2 ways in the remaining blanks. So, if 1 is in the \u0000rst place and 5 is in the 5th place, the\nother numbers can be arranged in 2*2 = 4 ways.

So, 2 occurs at the end 6*2 = 12 times. Similarly, 4 occurs 12 times.\nIf odd numbers occupy places 1 and 5, then 2 or 4 should come in the 3rd place. The other two numbers can\nthen be arranged in 2 ways in the remaining blanks. So, if 1 is in the \u0000rst place and 5 is in the 5th place, the\nother numbers can be arranged in 2*2 = 4 ways.

The other two numbers can\nthen be arranged in 2 ways in the remaining blanks. So, if 1 is in the \u0000rst place and 5 is in the 5th place, the\nother numbers can be arranged in 2*2 = 4 ways.

Odd numbers can occupy\nplaces 1 and 3 in 3C2*2! = 6 ways. When 2 is at the 5th place, the other odd number and 4 can be arranged in\nthe remaining places in 2 ways. So, 2 occurs at the end 6*2 = 12 times. Similarly, 4 occurs 12 times.\nIf odd numbers occupy places 1 and 5, then 2 or 4 should come in the 3rd place. The other two numbers can\nthen be arranged in 2 ways in the remaining blanks. So, if 1 is in the \u0000rst place and 5 is in the 5th place, the\nother numbers can be arranged in 2*2 = 4 ways. Similar for 1 and 3; 5 and 1; 3 and 1; 5 and 3; 3 and 5. So, 5\noccurs 8 times, 1 8 times and 3 8 times. Similar is the case when odd numbers are placed in 3rd and 5th\nplaces.\nOn the whole, 4 occurs 12 times, 2 occurs 12 times, 5, 3 and 1 each occur 16 times.

The other two numbers can\nthen be arranged in 2 ways in the remaining blanks. So, if 1 is in the \u0000rst place and 5 is in the 5th place, the\nother numbers can be arranged in 2*2 = 4 ways.

So, 2 occurs at the end 6*2 = 12 times. Similarly, 4 occurs 12 times.\nIf odd numbers occupy places 1 and 5, then 2 or 4 should come in the 3rd place. The other two numbers can\nthen be arranged in 2 ways in the remaining blanks. So, if 1 is in the \u0000rst place and 5 is in the 5th place, the\nother numbers can be arranged in 2*2 = 4 ways.

The other two numbers can\nthen be arranged in 2 ways in the remaining blanks. So, if 1 is in the \u0000rst place and 5 is in the 5th place, the\nother numbers can be arranged in 2*2 = 4 ways.

Odd numbers can occupy\nplaces 1 and 3 in 3C2*2! = 6 ways. When 2 is at the 5th place, the other odd number and 4 can be arranged in\nthe remaining places in 2 ways. So, 2 occurs at the end 6*2 = 12 times. Similarly, 4 occurs 12 times.\nIf odd numbers occupy places 1 and 5, then 2 or 4 should come in the 3rd place. The other two numbers can\nthen be arranged in 2 ways in the remaining blanks. So, if 1 is in the \u0000rst place and 5 is in the 5th place, the\nother numbers can be arranged in 2*2 = 4 ways. Similar for 1 and 3; 5 and 1; 3 and 1; 5 and 3; 3 and 5. So, 5\noccurs 8 times, 1 8 times and 3 8 times. Similar is the case when odd numbers are placed in 3rd and 5th\nplaces.\nOn the whole, 4 occurs 12 times, 2 occurs 12 times, 5, 3 and 1 each occur 16 times.

The other two numbers can\nthen be arranged in 2 ways in the remaining blanks. So, if 1 is in the \u0000rst place and 5 is in the 5th place, the\nother numbers can be arranged in 2*2 = 4 ways.

So, 2 occurs at the end 6*2 = 12 times. Similarly, 4 occurs 12 times.\nIf odd numbers occupy places 1 and 5, then 2 or 4 should come in the 3rd place. The other two numbers can\nthen be arranged in 2 ways in the remaining blanks. So, if 1 is in the \u0000rst place and 5 is in the 5th place, the\nother numbers can be arranged in 2*2 = 4 ways.

We have cases including a selection of only 7, only 8 and neither 7 nor 8.\nConsidering the cases, only 7 is selected.\nWe can select a maximum of 7 digit numbers. We must select 3, 5, and 7.\nHence we must have ( 3, 5, 7) for the remaining 4 numbers we have\nEach of the numbers can either be selected or not selected and we have 4 numbers :\nHence we have _ _ _ _ and 2 possibilities for each and hence a total of 2*2*2*2 = 16 possibilities.\nSImilarly, including only 8, we have 16 more possibilities.\nCases including neither 7 nor 8.\nWe must have 3 and 5 in the group but there must be no 7 and 8 in the group.\nHence we have 3 5 _ _ _ _.\nFor the 4 blanks, we can have 2 possibilities for either placing a number or not among 1, 2, 4, 6.\n= 16 possibilities\nBut we must remove the case where neither of the 4 numbers are placed because the number becomes a two-\ndigit number.\nHence 16 - 1 = 15 cases.\nTotal = 16+15+16 = 47 possibilities\n44.D\nFirst a black square can be selected in 32 ways. Out of remaining rows and columns, 24 white squares remain.\n1 white square can them be chosen in 24 ways. So total no. of ways of selection is 32*24 = 768.\n45.B\nIf there is only 1 green ball, it can be done in 6 ways\nIf there are 2 green balls, it can be done in 5 ways.\n.\n.\n.\nIf there are 6 green balls, it can be done in 1 way.\nSo, the total number of possibilities is 6*7/2 = 21\nC =\n6\n2\n15\nC\n \n=\n6\n3\n20\nC =\n6\n4\n15\n\n VIDEO SOLUTION\n\n VIEW SOLUTION\n\n VIDEO SOLUTION\n\nDownloaded from Cracku.in\nFor MBA/CAT Courses:  6303239042\n37/37\n46.70\nLet the numbers be of the form 100a+10b+c, where a, b, and c represent single digits.\nThen (100c+10b+a)-(100a+10b+c)=198\n99c-99a=198\nc-a = 2.\nNow, a can take the values 1-7. a cannot be zero as the initial number has 3 digits and cannot be 8 or 9 as then\nc would not be a single-digit number.\nThus, there can be 7 cases.\nB can take the value of any digit from 0-9, as it does not affect the answer. Hence, the total cases will be \n.\n47.C\nIf there are 3 symmetric letters, it can be formed in 11*10*9 ways\nIf there are 2 symmetric letters, it can be formed in 11C2 * 15C1 * 3! ways\nIf there is only 1 symmetric letter, the password can be formed in 15C2*11C1*3! ways\nTotal = 990+330*15+630*11 = 12870 ways\n48.C\n x, y and z in the hundred's, ten's and unit's place. So y should start from 2\nIf y=2 , possible values of x=1 and z = 0,1 .So 2 cases 120,121.\nAlso if y=3 , possible values of x=1,2 and z=0,1,2.\nHere 6 three digit nos. possible .\nSimilarly for next cases would be 3*4=12,4*5=20,5*6=30,.....,8*9=72 .

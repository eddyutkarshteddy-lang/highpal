---

## 🔧 Quick Fix Needed

### File: `src/App.jsx`
**Location:** Around line 200+ in the main return statement
**Add this code block:**

```javascript
// Add this routing block in the main return statement
if (currentView === 'revision') {
  return (
    <RevisionMode 
      uploadedFiles={uploadedFiles} 
      onBackToChat={() => setCurrentView('chat')} 
    />
  );
}
```

### Complete Implementation Steps:
1. Open `src/App.jsx`
2. Find the main return statement (after all the handler functions)
3. Look for existing view routing (likely has `if (currentView === 'landing')` and `if (currentView === 'chat')`)
4. Add the revision routing block above
5. Save the file
6. Test the complete flow:
   - Upload a document in My Book mode
   - Click "Start Quiz" button
   - Verify quiz interface loads
   - Answer questions and check feedback
   - Return to chat mode works

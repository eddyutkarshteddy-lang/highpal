# 🎯 Switching to VAD (No Wake Words) - Like Sesame.com

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Goal:** Replace wake-word system with VAD for natural conversation  
**Inspiration:** Sesame.com (no wake words, natural interruption)

---

## 🤔 **Why VAD Instead of Wake Words?**

### **Sesame.com Approach:**
- ✅ Speak naturally, no "Hey X" needed
- ✅ Interrupt anytime by just talking
- ✅ AI detects voice activity, not specific words
- ✅ More natural, conversational UX

### **Current System (Wake Words):**
- ❌ Must say "Listen Pal" or "Pal" to interrupt
- ❌ Less natural conversation flow
- ❌ Extra cognitive load for users
- ❌ Not like Sesame.com

## ✅ **VAD System (Already Built!)**

We have all the pieces ready:

1. **`vadDetector.js`** - Silero VAD (FREE, ML-based)
2. **`azureStreamingClient.js`** - Azure streaming STT
3. **`interruptManager.js`** - State management

## 🔧 **Implementation Plan**

### **Replace:** Wake-word passive listening
### **With:** VAD + Azure Streaming

### **How it works:**

```
User starts speaking (ANY words)
    ↓
VAD detects speech in <50ms
    ↓
Azure Streaming STT starts
    ↓
Real-time transcription
    ↓
User stops speaking
    ↓
VAD detects silence
    ↓
Final transcript sent to AI
    ↓
AI responds
    ↓
User interrupts (just talk!)
    ↓
VAD detects interrupt
    ↓
AI fades out smoothly
    ↓
User's new input captured
```

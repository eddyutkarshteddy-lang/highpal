This document covers the integration of OpenAI's GPT-4o model into HighPal's emotionally intelligent educational assistant.

## üéØ **Why GPT-5 for Educational AI?**

### **Enhanced Capabilities:**
- **Superior Reasoning**: Advanced logical thinking for complex educational problems
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Better understanding of student emotional context
- **Educational Expertise**: Improved subject matter knowledge across competitive exams
- **Adaptive Explanations**: More personalized learning approaches
- **Multimodal Understanding**: Better integration with voice and text inputs

## üèóÔ∏è **Implementation in HighPal**

### **Model Configuration:**
```python
# OpenAI GPT-5 Configuration
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY'))

# GPT-5 for educational reasoning
def generate_educational_response(student_input, emotion_context):
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-5",  # Latest model
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "system", 
                "content": f"""You are HighPal, an emotionally intelligent educational assistant. 
                Student's current emotion: {emotion_context.get('primary_emotion')}
                Stress level: {emotion_context.get('stress_level')}/10
                Confidence level: {emotion_context.get('confidence_level')}/10
                
                Adapt your teaching style to their emotional state:
                - If stressed: Use calming, step-by-step approach
                - If confused: Provide clear, simple explanations
                - If confident: Challenge with advanced concepts
                - If frustrated: Offer encouragement and break down problems
                """
            },
            {
                "role": "user", 
                "content": student_input
            }
        ],
        temperature=0.7,
        max_tokens=500
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content
```

## üí∞ **GPT-5 Pricing Considerations**

### **Expected Pricing (Based on GPT-4 patterns):**
- **Input**: Likely $10-15 per 1M tokens
- **Output**: Likely $30-45 per 1M tokens
- **Educational Use**: ~2000 tokens per student interaction

### **Cost Per Student Session:**
- **Input**: ~1000 tokens √ó $0.015 = $0.015
- **Output**: ~1000 tokens √ó $0.045 = $0.045
- **Total**: ~$0.06 per educational interaction

### **Monthly Cost Estimates:**
- **100 students**: 20 sessions each = $120/month
- **500 students**: 20 sessions each = $600/month
- **1000 students**: 20 sessions each = $1,200/month

## üéì **Educational Optimizations for GPT-5**

### **Prompt Engineering for Learning:**
```python
EDUCATIONAL_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """

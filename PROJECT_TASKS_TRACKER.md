- **AI Speech Echo Detection:** Word-matching algorithm filters transcripts with 70%+ overlap with AI's own speech
- **Conversation State Check:** Ignore all transcripts after END button clicked to prevent late processing
- **Cleanup Order Fix:** Destroy Azure streaming before VAD to prevent late transcript callbacks
- **React State Fix:** Proper immutable state updates to eliminate mutation warnings

### UI Enhancements
- **Animated Pal Avatar:** State-based color changes (green=listening, orange=speaking, blue=processing, gray=idle)
- **Side Transcript Panel:** Real-time conversation history without verbose status overlays
- **Accent Selector Dropdown:** Flag emojis with clean, accessible UI for language selection
- **Lightweight Status Indicators:** Simple colored dots replace verbose text labels

### Architecture Improvements
- **State-Based Transcript Processing:** Only process speech during USER_SPEAKING/PROCESSING states
- **IDLE State Recovery:** Manually trigger speech detection when transcripts received in IDLE (catches missed VAD detections)
- **Ref-Based Guards:** Use conversationActiveRef instead of state variable to avoid closure issues in callbacks
- **Multi-Replace State Updates:** Use array.map() instead of direct mutation for React compliance

## ✅ Stability Patch – October 2, 2025 (v5.0.1)

### Voice & Conversation Reliability
- Fixed conversation context loss in voice flow by reading unified history from stable refs (prevents stale closure issues)
- Synced voice and chat histories so follow-up questions use the correct prior topic (e.g., “first president” after “India” now resolves to India)
- END button now immediately halts all audio (Azure TTS + browser speech) and prevents any new speech from starting
- Added global stop flag to block queued/starting playback and avoid late audio after ending

### Audio & Logging
- Improved Azure audio playback error handling with detailed diagnostics and safe fallbacks
- Removed noisy audio level console logging while keeping barge-in functionality intact
- Hardened passive listening controls to avoid AI self-interruption during playback

### UX
- END action stops instantly without playing a farewell line to honor user intent

    - Implement proper memory cleanup on component unmount
    - Test on low-end devices (mobile phones, old laptops)
    - Monitor CPU and memory usage during extended sessions

#### **Phase 5: Testing and Documentation (Day 3 - 4-6 hours)**
13. **🧪 Test Interrupt Reliability** (2-3 hours)
    - Test case 1: Say "Hey Pal" during AI speech - should interrupt within 100ms
    - Test case 2: Echo test - AI says "Hey Pal" shouldn't self-trigger
    - Test case 3: Background noise - TV/music shouldn't cause false triggers
    - Test case 4: Multiple rapid interrupts in succession
    - Target: >95% detection rate with <2% false positives
    - Document test results and edge cases discovered
    
14. **📊 Add Analytics and Monitoring** (1-2 hours)
    - Track metrics: wake word detection rate, false positive rate
    - Measure latency from detection to AI stop (target <100ms)
    - Add user satisfaction tracking (did interrupt work as expected?)
    - Log to backend analytics service or local storage
    - Use data for continuous tuning of sensitivity thresholds
    
15. **📝 Update Documentation** (1 hour)
